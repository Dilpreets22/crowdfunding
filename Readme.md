This project implements a decentralized crowdfunding platform using Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The smart contract allows users to create fundraising campaigns with a funding goal and deadline. 
Contributors (backers) can donate Ether to campaigns, and if the goal is met before the deadline, the funds are transferred to the campaign creator.
If not, contributors can withdraw their funds. The system ensures transparency, security, and trust without relying on intermediaries.

Key features include:

Campaign creation with goal and time limit

Secure fund contributions using Ethereum

Automatic fund transfer or refund logic

Event logging for real-time tracking and accountability

This project demonstrates the potential of blockchain for transparent, trustless fundraising.
